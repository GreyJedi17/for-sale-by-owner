        <!--This section introduces the purpose of For Sale By Owner-->
        <p>I bet you are all wondering why this website exists. Truth be told, I was hoping to help others avoid realtor fees. The way I see it, selling your home should not cause additional stress knowing you have to pay 6% or more of your earnings for someone to sign your paperwork.</p>
        <p>I have yet to personally have experience with realtors, but I'll admit the idea is not one that sits well with me.</p>
